abstract: We study a symmetric private value auction with signaling, in which the
  auction outcome is used by an outside observer to infer the bidders' types. We elicit
  conditions under which an essentially unique D1 equilibrium bidding function exists
  in the second-price and the English auctions. We establish there is no equivalence
  between these two auction designs, neither in bidding strategies nor in expected
  revenue. This is because the presence or the absence of an increasing price clock
  affects signaling incentives differently in both auction formats, and thereby also
  the bidders' incentives to overbid their types. This leads to a strictly higher
  expected revenue in the second-price auction than in the English auction. Our analysis
  is completed by a comparison with other disclosure policies. Applications include
  art auctions and charity auctions.
