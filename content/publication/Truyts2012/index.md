abstract: Commodities communicate. We investigate optimal indirect taxation when both
  the intrinsic qualities of goods and signaling motivate consumption choices. Optimal
  indirect taxes are introduced into a monotonic signaling game. We provide sufficient
  conditions for the uniqueness of the D1 sequential equilibrium strate- gies. In
  the case of pure costly signaling, signaling goods can in equilibrium be taxed without
  burden. When commodities serve both intrinsic consumption and signaling, optimal
  taxes are characterized by a Ramsey rule, which deals with distortions resulting
  from signaling.
