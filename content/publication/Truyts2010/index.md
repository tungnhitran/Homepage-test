abstract: Social distinction or status is an important motivation of human behaviour.
  This paper provides a selective survey of recent advances in the economic analysis
  of the origins and consequences of social status concerns. First, a selection of
  empirical research from a variety of scientific disciplines is discussed to underpin
  the further theoretical analysis. I then consider the origins and determinants of
  tastes for status, discuss the endogenous derivation of such preferences for relative
  standing and assess the different formalizations of these preferences. Subsequently,
  the consequences of preferences for status are studied for a variety of problems
  and settings. The last section discusses a number of implications of status concerns
  for normative economics and public policy.
