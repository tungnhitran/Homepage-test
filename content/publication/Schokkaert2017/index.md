abstract: We model inter-individual differences in preferences for redistribution
  as a function of (a) self-interest; (b) ideas about the deservingness of income
  differences due to luck, effort and talent; (c) subjective perceptions of the relative
  importance of these determinants for explaining the actual income distribution.
  Individuals base the latter on information obtained from their reference group.
  We analyse the consequences for redistributive preferences of homophilous reference
  group formation based on talent. Our model makes it possible to understand and integrate
  some of the main insights from the empirical literature. We illustrate with GSS
  data from 1987 how our model may help in structuring empirical work.
