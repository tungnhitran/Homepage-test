abstract: In the past decades, the economic analysis of social networks and groups
  has rapidly developed. This article discusses a few mechanisms through which social
  networks and groups affect poverty and social and economic inequality. Social net-
  works and groups can both keep people in poverty or be tools for the emancipation
  of the poor. An efficient poverty reducing policy should account for these mechanisms
  or even employ them for the greater good.
