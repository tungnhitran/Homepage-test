abstract: 'We study the relative performance of the first-price sealed-bid auction,
  the second-price sealed-bid auction, and the all-pay sealed-bid auction in a laboratory
  experiment where bidders can signal information through their bidding behaviour
  to an outside observer. We consider two different information settings: the auctioneer
  reveals either the identity of the winning bidder only, or she also reveals the
  bidders'' payments to an outside observer. We find that the all-pay sealed-bid auction
  in which the bidders'' payments are revealed outperforms the other mechanisms in
  terms of revenue, while this mechanism underperforms in terms of efficiency relative
  to the winner-pay auctions.'
