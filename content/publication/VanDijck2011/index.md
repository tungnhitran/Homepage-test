abstract: Economic interests, ideas, and politics have been put forward as explanations
  for the Repeal of the British Corn Laws. This article evaluates these competing
  explanations using the case of the Belgian Corn Laws between 1834 and 1873. A detailed
  quantitative analysis assesses the success of party affiliation and personal and
  constituency economic interests in predicting representatives' voting behavior.
  These factors prove to be insufficient to explain the shift towards free trade.
  This article then moves on to a qualitative analysis, which points to the importance
  of political strategy and ideas in the liberalization of corn tariffs.
